    <p>

Little Boy needs to collect some stars, but is allergic to bugs and HATES water! Use the keyboard arrows to lead Little Boy 
to collect the stars (which magically will blink him back to the starting area). Avoid both the bugs and water, and be careful; 
those darn bugs get faster when you take more stars!
 </p>
  <p>
    <h3 class="subdued">Tips</h3>
Collect a star will gain 2 points, run into bugs will lose 1 point.  Try to avoid the bugs as much as you can, you can even use down button to move backward.
